### Analyzing gene expression in humans using RNA seq

#### Overview
-[1.] Download two samples of human RNA-Seq data
-[2.] Download latest assembly of the human genome plus its sequence annotations
-[3.] Perform quality control with 'FastQC' and 'MultiQC'
-[4.] Perform trimming and adapter removal with 'cutadapt'
-[5.] Map reads against specific chromosome of human reference genome with 'STAR'
-[6.] Remove duplicate reads
-[7.] Count number of mapping reads
